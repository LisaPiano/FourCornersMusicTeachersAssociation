            <p>Welcome to the Four Corners Music Teachers Association!
                I'm Kristen Folden, Co-President of 4CMTA, and I would like to encourage all students, teachers,
                and lovers of music to explore everything our organization has to offer. Especially now, it
                is important for us to join together to find strength in the joy of making music and
                in the love of teaching and learning. The Four Corners Teachers Association is here to help teachers
                and students share their ideas,
                creativity and vision. It brings teachers together to explore pedagogy and meaningful musical
                experiences. If you would like more
                information about 4CMTA, please email me at <a href="mailto:kcpiano1@gmail.com"

        <p>Greetings to you all! My name is Mika Inouye, and as Co-President, I would also like to welcome
            you to our organization. 4CMTA endeavors to provide students with opportunities for education and
            performances as
            solosits and as chamber musicians. Our commitment to making and sharing music will persevere despite
            pandemic adversity, and our continued involvement enables us to feel connected as a musical community. Our
            parent organizations are the <a href="http://www.comusicteachers.net/" target="_blank" class="email">Colorado State Music
                Teachers Association (CSMTA)</a>
            and the <a href="https://www.mtna.org/" target="-blank" class="email">Music Teachers National Association (MTNA).</a>Both of
            these organizations
            offer tremendous benefits and learning opportunities. I would be happy to talk with you more about joining
            our associations, so
