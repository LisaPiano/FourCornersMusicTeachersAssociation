This is a website that I am creating for the official music teachers organization
that exists in the Four Corners. The 4CMTA (Four Corners Teachers Organization)
is an organization of teachers and students that perform and study music.
This website will provide recources for all musicians to share information
about students, teachers, and events such as performances and competitions. 
This is the first entire official webpage that I have created!

I am creating this site using pure vanilla HTML, CSS and JS.
