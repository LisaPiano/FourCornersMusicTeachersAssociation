        <p><span id="firstWord">The Piano Academy at Fort Lewis College </span>provides an exceptional opportunity
             for young intermediate to advanced pianists grades 4-12 to improve their skills and teamwork. Auditions 
             are required. Daily private lessons and group coachings will improve sight-reading, technique,
              working with others, all while having fun. Students perform a final recital for family and friends on
               Thursday, and can experience learning piano literature, music history, and music theory in a collegiate
                classroom. They will also get to participate in physical and creative activities while enjoying the 
                breathtaking views on Fort Lewis Collegeâ€™s campus.</p><br>

            <p>Audition videos and registration are due to the Piano Academy are due by Friday, March 14.
             Please perform one short piece with a camera angle that ensures that hands and feet are visible and
              provide a link to an unlisted video on YouTube. You can find the application on the 4CTMA website.
            
            Applicants may substitute their virtual audition by performing a work by auditioning at the FLC Piano
             and Strings Day (March 8th) or performing at one of the 2025 Durango Bach Festival Student Recitals
